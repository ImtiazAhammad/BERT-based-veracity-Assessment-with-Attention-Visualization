# BERT-based-veracity-Assessment-with-Attention-Visualization
Welcome to the BERT-based Veracity Assessment with Attention Visualization repository! This project leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to assess the veracity of statements and provides visualizations of the attention mechanisms to help understand the model's decision-making process.



# Introduction
This project aims to develop a system that can evaluate the veracity of textual statements using BERT. The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of labeled statements to classify them as true or false. Additionally, the project includes tools for visualizing the attention mechanisms within BERT, providing insights into how the model interprets different parts of the input text.

# Features
Veracity Assessment: Classify statements as true or false using a fine-tuned BERT model.
Attention Visualization: Interactive visualizations of BERT's attention layers to understand the model's focus.
