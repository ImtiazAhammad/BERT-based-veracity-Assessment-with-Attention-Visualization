# BERT-based-veracity-Assessment-with-Attention-Visualization
Welcome to the BERT-based Veracity Assessment with Attention Visualization repository! This project leverages the power of BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to assess the veracity of statements and provides visualizations of the attention mechanisms to help understand the model's decision-making process.
